title: Loki
---

Poller optionally provides support for writing UniFi's Events, Anomalies, Alarms and IDS data to Loki.
There are no dashboards for this data, but it's pretty simple. Just add a "Logs" panel.
You can also use this data as an Annotation source.

:::note
Loki support was added in UniFi Poller v2.0.2.

## Installation

Installation of Loki is documented [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/installation/).
If you're only using Poller, you don't need Promtail.

## Usage

Just add the Loki URL to your poller config to enable this output plugin.

```toml
[loki]
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:3100"
```

Use the UniFi input plugin settings to choose which logs to collect and save. Example:

```toml
[unifi.defaults]
  save_ids       = true
  save_events    = true
  save_alarms    = true
  save_anomalies = true
```

:::important
Loki must be added as a data source to Grafana, and panels or annotations should be created with that data.
Grafana Labs documents **[Loki with Grafana usage](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/loki/)**.
Here's a **[bonus blog post](https://grafana.com/blog/2020/04/08/loki-quick-tip-how-to-create-a-grafana-dashboard-for-searching-logs-using-loki-and-prometheus/)**
about using Loki with Grafana.

## Advanced

The Loki output plugin has a few advanced settings that most folks won't use. These are their default values.

```toml
user       = ""
pass       = ""
verify_ssl = false
tenant_id  = ""
interval   = "2m"
timeout    = "10s"
```

You can set a user and pass if your Loki instance requires auth. This currently only supports Basic Auth.
Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/unpoller/unpoller/issues/) if you need support for something
else. Alternatively you can pass the Tenant ID header directly by setting `tenant_id`.
If your Loki instance is using/behind an SSL proxy that has a valid SSL cert you may set `verify_ssl` to true.
The recommended interval is `2m` but anything from `1m` to `15m` should work fine.
The timeout is `10s`, adjust it if you get timeout errors.

## Examples

The `docker-compose` example below (using Loki and Prometheus) was kindly provided by a community member.
